    "He wasn't from a rare species, just an ordinary boy.{p}He wasn't unhealthy, just a normal boy in every way."
    "However, he was from an especially\npoor family in Minasato Village."
    "Perhaps because of that, despite his normality,{w=.2}\nhe had a certain particular habit.{p}Rather than an action, it was more of a catchphrase."
    "「Can I take that? 」"
    "Despite how young he was,\nhe seemed to understand how poor his household was."
    "He would never ask that of things\nthat were important to others."
    "But for unneeded things that were still usable,\nhe would often say that."
    "Friends,{w=.2} teachers,{w=.2} the adult villagers.{p}Anyone, really."
    "The boy was always kind to everyone."
    "To the ones he asked, they'd often\nalready thought about tossing it away."
    "With no special reason to refuse him,\nthey would give it to him."
    "After some point,{w=.2} it seemed as if everyone\nbegan asking the boy if\nhe wanted everything they threw away."
    "In a way, it was a version of modern day recycling.{p}No one was unhappy about it,\nand it was a simple relationship."
    "However, with such a strangely projected-on person,{w=.2}\nthere was a certain seed of inevitability."
    "Amongst that boy's classmates,{w=.2}\nthere seemed to be such a child."
    "Thus, several of those unpleasant boys gathered,{w=.2}\nand several instances of bullying occurred."
    "In this boy's case,{w=.2} he was placed\nunder that unfortunate circumstance."
    "The boy was exposed to many forms of bullying.{p}However, the boy just endured it,\nnever crying, even for a moment."
    "When any onlookers saw this state of affairs,{w=.2}\nit seemed as though they\nthought it couldn't be helped."
    "That was considered the wise decision.{p}And yet, the consequences were far from ideal."
    "As the boy showed no reaction to the bullying,{w=.2}\nthe other children began to steadily\nescalate their actions."
    "That may be where it all began,{w=.2}\nThe shopkeeper said."
    "The bullying became much more direct,{w=.2}\nand at last the boy was dealt a serious injury."
    "From his right eye down his cheek,\nthere was a great big gash."
    "With such a deep wound,{w=.2} the boy lost his right eye,\nand was left with an enormous scar.{p}It seems that's what the doctor said."
    "However, the medical treatment required money."
    "The boy's family was especially poor in the village.{p}Yet they still had something saved up."
    "The boy's parents would use those savings,{w=.2}\nand one way or another the\nboy's wound would be healed."
    "It was the silver lining in the cloud."
    "...Yes, that was what anyone who saw the boy thought.{p}He had lost his right eye,{w=.2}\nbut he still had his life."
    "However the boy did not join in\nwith everyone's happiness around him,{w=.2}\nand he fully embraced the unhappiness within himself."
    "It wasn't even a few days after the cut was stitched{w=.2}\nbefore the boy collapsed due to a high fever."
    "The doctor examined him,{w=.2} only to realize that\nthe gash had become a dangerous weapon of sorts:\nBacteria had entered through it."
    "The boy's parents cried as they asked the doctor.{p}「Isn't there anything you can do? 」"
    "To that, the doctor replied slowly and calmly.{p}「There is a way. For this infection,{w=.2}\nthere is an effective medicine. 」"
    "「Then, our boy will- 」"
    "「Please be calm.{w=.2}\nTo be sure, I have found that medicine.{p}However... 」"
    "However,{w} the medicine was expensively priced,{p}as the doctor calmy and cruelly informed the parents."
    "The boy's family was the poorest in the village.{p}Yet they still had something saved up.{p}But now, it was no longer enough."
    "They frantically did what they could to gather money.{p}They worked from sun up to sun down,{w=.2}\nas well as asking their acquaintances."
    "Still, even that wasn't enough.{p}Time waits for no one,{w=.2}\nand it brings all to the same end."
    "And then, on the third day after the boy's collapse,\nhe departed from this world."
    "At his side as he laid face up,{w=.2} the boy's\napologetic parents only said, 「we can't do anything\nabout it, 」 and then it was as if he went to sleep."
    "This family was the poorest in all the village.{p}As such, the funeral service was carried out quietly."
    "But according to that family,\nall of the villagers attended and offered incense.{p}"
    "Among them, there was one\nchild who cried in front of the deceased."
    "It was that child,{w=.2}\nthe one who had given him the injury."
    "While the boy was alive, when asked about the wound\nhe would say 「I fell by myself. 」"
    "But such a wound could not be sustained from falling.{w=.2}\nWhen pressed, the parents, the doctor, and the boy\nall insisted that it was a fall until the end."
    "The poor boy died, and though\nthe bully realized the weight of his actions,{p}no one had the courage to speak to him about them."
    "So he could only cry before the boy's grave,{p}all the while apologizing desperately from his heart."
    "Even after the service ended,\nthe bully kept crying.{p}The soul-crushing weight never disappeared."
    "On the contrary, it kept piling up.{p}If he spoke to anyone he would have been comforted.{p}Sadly, he never found the courage."
    "「What if I just died? 」{p}Before he knew it, he was thinking about it."
    "Then one day, the bully saw the boy in a dream."
    "The distance between them was great,\nand it was also dark,\nso it was difficult to see the face."
    "But the gash down his face was visible,{w=.2}\nand it appeared that was all the boy thought about."
    "「Why are you making such a pained face? 」"
    "The boy asked, in the same kind\ntone he used with everyone.{p}"
    "Maybe it was because it was a dream,\nor maybe because it was the one he wronged."
    "Either way,\nthe bully let out everything that\nhe had been bottling up."
    "「I'm sorry that I killed you.{p}But I never told that to anyone.{p}I thought about dying too, and it hurts. 」"
    "「I see... 」"
    "The boy whispered quietly, then continued on like so."

    "「Yeah, if it makes me feel better,\nthen dying is okay.{p}I don't want my life anymore! 」"
    "「Really. In that case... 」"
