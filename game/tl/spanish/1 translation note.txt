A quick note when translating this game:

If you see any unusual text within the dialogue, you'll need to include it in the translated text

Example are the following:

Anything within a [] or {} : denotes a variable being used or an aspect of the text being altered such a pause, its size or its speed

\n : continues the text on a new line without stopping

\" or \' : tells the game to include the quotation in the text rather than using it to recognize the beginning or end of a string 

Åu and Åv : these are used in the original to show a character is speaking out loud.  It will be up to you to decide if you'd wish to use them as well, or take them out completely.  
If you use these, be sure to leave an extra space before the Åv, otherwise it will look a bit awkward hugging the text.
